# SlideSpeech: Auto Presentation Script

SlideSpeech is a Python script that automates the presentation of PDF or PPTX files, playing an audio file for each slide. The time spent on each slide depends on the duration of the corresponding audio file. The script supports **multiple presentations**, allowing you to choose which one to start when running the script.

```

### 3. Prepare Your Files
- **Presentations**: Place each presentation in its own folder under the `presentations` directory.

## Notes
- Ensure the audio files are named sequentially (`slide_1.wav`, `slide_2.wav`, etc.) and correspond to each slide.
- The script uses the `right` arrow key to navigate slides, which works in most presentation software.
- If you're using a PPTX file, ensure the `python-pptx` library is installed.
- Test the script with your presentation and audio files before using it in a live setting.
